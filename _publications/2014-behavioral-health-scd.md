This study investigates the behavioral health needs of patients with sickle cell disease who seek care in emergency department settings. The research identifies common behavioral health concerns, examines current screening practices, and explores opportunities for integrated behavioral health services within emergency care for this population. Findings highlight the importance of addressing psychological aspects of pain management in acute care settings for patients with sickle cell disease.
