This study provides a comprehensive analysis of Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) compliant data catalogs across different levels of government in the United States. The research examines structural characteristics, content patterns, implementation strategies, and thematic elements across federal, state, county, city, and territorial entities, identifying key trends and best practices in open data standardization efforts.

## Abstract

The Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) has emerged as a critical standard for enhancing the interoperability and discoverability of public datasets. This study presents a systematic analysis of DCAT implementation across U.S. governmental entities at federal, state, county, city, and territorial levels. Using a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative metrics and qualitative content analysis, we examined 143 DCAT-compliant data catalogs to identify structural characteristics, metadata quality patterns, and thematic priorities. Results reveal substantial heterogeneity in implementation approaches, with federal catalogs demonstrating the highest compliance rates and metadata completeness. Geospatial, health, and environmental datasets were most prevalent across all catalog types. The study identifies significant gaps in standardization practices, particularly at local government levels where resource limitations often constrain metadata quality. These findings provide an empirical foundation for targeted interventions to strengthen DCAT implementation and enhance public data utility across diverse governmental contexts.

## Key Findings

- Federal data catalogs demonstrate significantly higher DCAT compliance rates (87%) compared to state (63%), county (42%), and municipal (38%) catalogs
- Metadata completeness shows substantial variation, with particularly low rates of temporal coverage specification in local government catalogs
- Geographic distribution analysis reveals regional patterns in DCAT adoption, with coastal states showing earlier and more comprehensive implementation
- Thematic analysis identified eight primary dataset categories, with geospatial, health, and environmental data being most represented
- Resource constraints at local government levels emerged as the primary barrier to comprehensive DCAT implementation

This research contributes to our understanding of open data standardization practices and provides practical recommendations for improving interoperability across governmental data ecosystems.
