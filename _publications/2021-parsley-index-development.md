This paper details the development and initial validation of the Parsley Symptom Index (PSI), a novel digital patient-reported outcome measurement designed specifically for adults with chronic disease. The research outlines the methodological approach to instrument development, item generation, preliminary testing, and validation in a prospective cohort. The PSI represents an important advancement in digital symptom tracking for chronic disease management.
