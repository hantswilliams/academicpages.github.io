This experimental study investigates how cognitive reappraisal strategies influence both behavioral and neural responses to social stimuli. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques, the research examines the neural correlates of emotional regulation during exposure to various social cues. The findings demonstrate that reappraisal effectively modulates both subjective experience and neural activation patterns in response to social stimuli, contributing to our understanding of emotion regulation mechanisms.
