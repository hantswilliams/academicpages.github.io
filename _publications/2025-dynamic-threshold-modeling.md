This paper presents a novel machine learning approach for predicting injury risk in collegiate athletes using dynamic threshold modeling of inter-limb symmetry measurements. The research leverages longitudinal data from diverse collegiate athletic populations to develop adaptive threshold models that account for sport-specific demands, individual athlete characteristics, and temporal changes in movement patterns. This work aims to advance injury prevention practices by providing more personalized and context-sensitive risk assessment tools.

**Status:** In draft, planned submission 2025-2026.
