This study investigates geographic disparities in private equity (PE) hospital ownership patterns and analyzes how PE acquisition differentially affects radiology services in rural versus urban healthcare settings. The research examines both financial metrics and quality indicators before and after PE acquisition across diverse geographic regions. Findings highlight important implications for healthcare equity, particularly for underserved rural communities, and inform policy considerations regarding private equity involvement in healthcare delivery systems.

**Status:** In draft, planned submission 2025-2026 to The Journal for Poor and Underserved.
