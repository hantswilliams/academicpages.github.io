This experimental study investigates how cognitive reappraisal, an emotion regulation strategy, affects extinction processes in both healthy individuals and those with social anxiety. The research employs psychophysiological measurements to assess fear conditioning and extinction while manipulating reappraisal instructions. Results demonstrate that reappraisal facilitates extinction across both populations, suggesting potential mechanisms for enhancing exposure therapy effectiveness in anxiety disorders.
