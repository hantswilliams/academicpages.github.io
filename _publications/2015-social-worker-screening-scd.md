This paper presents the development and implementation of a structured social worker screening process designed to identify unmet psychological and social needs in adults with sickle cell disease who present to the emergency department. The research examines the feasibility of implementing such a process within the emergency care setting and presents preliminary data on the types of unmet needs identified through this screening approach.
