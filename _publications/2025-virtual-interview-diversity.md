This study analyzes the impact of virtual interview formats, implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic, on diversity metrics in physician assistant program admissions. The research compares demographic data from applicant cohorts before and after the transition to virtual interviews, examining changes in representation across various dimensions of diversity. Currently in the resubmission phase after addressing reviewer feedback, this work provides important insights for admissions committees considering the long-term adoption of virtual interview formats.
