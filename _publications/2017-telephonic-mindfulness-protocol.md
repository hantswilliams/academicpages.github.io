This paper presents the detailed protocol for a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of a telephonic mindfulness-based intervention for pain management in individuals with sickle cell disease. The protocol outlines the study design, participant recruitment strategies, intervention components, outcome measures, and analytic approach. This research aims to establish the effectiveness of remote mindfulness-based approaches for chronic pain management in underserved populations with limited access to specialized pain services.
