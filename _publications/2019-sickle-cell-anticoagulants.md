This clinical study compares bleeding complications among sickle cell disease (SCD) patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) when treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) versus traditional anticoagulants such as vitamin K antagonists and low-molecular-weight heparin. The research demonstrates a significantly lower incidence of bleeding complications in patients treated with DOACs, suggesting a potentially safer anticoagulation approach for this high-risk population.
