This study investigates the acceptability and feasibility of a mindfulness-based intervention designed to address pain catastrophizing among individuals living with sickle cell disease. The research evaluates participant engagement, retention rates, intervention adherence, and preliminary efficacy outcomes. Findings suggest that mindfulness-based approaches may offer a promising non-pharmacological strategy for pain management in this population.
