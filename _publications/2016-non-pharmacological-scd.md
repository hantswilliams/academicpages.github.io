This doctoral dissertation describes the development, theoretical foundation, and preliminary testing of a mindfulness-based intervention specifically designed for pain management in individuals with sickle cell disease. The work includes a comprehensive literature review on non-pharmacological pain management approaches, details the methodological process of adapting mindfulness practices for this population, and presents preliminary data on feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy outcomes. This research contributes to the growing field of non-pharmacological pain management strategies for chronic pain conditions.
