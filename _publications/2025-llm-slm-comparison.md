This paper provides a comprehensive comparison between remote closed-source large language models (LLMs) and locally deployable open-source small language models (SLMs), with a specific focus on healthcare applications. The research evaluates performance, privacy considerations, implementation requirements, and cost implications. Additionally, the paper includes a detailed tutorial for deploying SLMs in local healthcare environments, making advanced natural language processing capabilities accessible to resource-constrained settings.

**Status:** Initially submitted to Journal American Medical Informatics Association; currently being revised for submission to the International Journal of Medical Informatics.
