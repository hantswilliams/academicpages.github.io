This prospective cohort study evaluates the validity of the Parsley Symptom Index (PSI), an electronic patient-reported outcome measure specifically designed for telehealth applications. The research demonstrates the instrument's psychometric properties, validity metrics, and clinical utility in remote patient monitoring and symptom assessment. Findings support the PSI as a valid tool for telehealth-based chronic disease management.
