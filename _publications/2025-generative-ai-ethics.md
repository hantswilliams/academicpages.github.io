This research evaluates the ethical reasoning capabilities of four leading generative AI models when presented with complex healthcare ethics scenarios. The study employs a standardized assessment framework to compare model responses across five carefully constructed clinical ethical dilemmas, evaluating factors such as principle recognition, stakeholder consideration, reasoning process, and alignment with established ethical frameworks. This work contributes to our understanding of AI limitations and capabilities in ethically sensitive healthcare contexts.

**Status:** In draft, planned submission 2025-2026.
