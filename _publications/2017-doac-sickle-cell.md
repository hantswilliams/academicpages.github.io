This research examines the bleeding risk associated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) compared to traditional anticoagulation methods in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) who develop venous thromboembolism (VTE). The study demonstrates that DOACs are associated with significantly lower bleeding rates in this high-risk population, suggesting they may be a safer alternative for anticoagulation therapy in SCD patients requiring treatment for VTE.
