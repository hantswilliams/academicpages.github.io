This article analyzes the 2016 National Pain Strategy and highlights the essential yet frequently overlooked role of nurses in its successful implementation. The paper discusses how nurses are uniquely positioned at the frontlines of pain management across healthcare settings and argues for greater recognition of nursing contributions in national pain policy. Recommendations are provided for enhancing the nursing role in interdisciplinary pain management approaches and incorporating nursing perspectives in future policy development.
