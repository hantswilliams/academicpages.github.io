This study investigates the relationship between employment status and healthcare utilization patterns among individuals with sickle cell disease. The research identifies employment as a significant predictor of decreased healthcare utilization, highlighting the importance of considering social determinants of health in chronic disease management. The findings suggest that employment support and vocational rehabilitation may serve as valuable interventions to improve health outcomes in this population.
