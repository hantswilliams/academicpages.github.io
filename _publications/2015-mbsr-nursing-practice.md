This article explores the integration of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) into advanced nursing practice as a non-pharmacological approach to health promotion, chronic disease management, and symptom control. The paper reviews the evidence supporting MBSR across various patient populations, discusses practical implementation strategies for nursing settings, and addresses considerations for advanced practice nurses seeking to incorporate mindfulness-based approaches into their clinical practice. The authors highlight the alignment between MBSR principles and holistic nursing philosophy.
