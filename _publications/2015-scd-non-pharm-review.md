This comprehensive review examines the evidence base for non-pharmacological approaches to pain management in sickle cell disease. The paper systematically evaluates psychological interventions, physical modalities, complementary therapies, and self-management strategies, providing a critical analysis of their efficacy, limitations, and implementation considerations. The review highlights promising non-pharmacological options that may complement standard pharmacological treatments and offers recommendations for clinical practice and future research directions.
