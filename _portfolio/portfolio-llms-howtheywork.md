In this [interactive demo](https://llm.hants-williams.com/), I showcase the logic behind how Large Language Models (LLMs) work.

## Overview

Large Language Models are sophisticated AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data. When you interact with an LLM through its API, several complex processes work together to understand your input and generate appropriate responses. This is a simplified, high-level overview of how LLMs work. The actual implementations are much more complex and vary between different models and providers.

## Key Components

### 1. API Request Preparation

The interaction begins with your input being sent to the LLM along with configuration parameters that control the model's behavior and output characteristics.

**Common Parameters:**
- **Model Selection:** Different models offer varying capabilities and specializations
- **Temperature:** Controls output randomness and creativity (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Max Tokens:** Limits the length of the generated response
- **System Message:** Sets the context and behavior of the model

### 2. Tokenization Process

LLMs process text by breaking it down into tokens - the fundamental units they understand. These can be words, subwords, or characters, optimized based on the model's training data and vocabulary.

**Example Tokenization:**
Input: "Hello, how are you?"
- "Hello"
- ","
- "how"
- "are"
- "you"
- "?"

### 3. Neural Processing

The model processes tokens through its neural network architecture, employing various mechanisms to understand context and relationships between tokens.

**Key Components:**
- Attention mechanisms for understanding relationships between words
- Pattern recognition from training data
- Contextual understanding across sequences
- Semantic and syntactic processing

### 4. Response Generation

The model generates responses iteratively, predicting the most probable next token based on the context and chosen parameters.

**Generation Process:**
- Calculate probability distribution over vocabulary
- Apply temperature and other parameters to adjust distribution
- Sample next token based on probabilities
- Add generated token to context window
- Repeat until completion or max tokens reached

## Common Characteristics

- **Architecture:** Based on transformer models with billions of parameters
- **Context Window:** Limited window size for processing input (varies by model)
- **Response Time:** Generation speed varies based on model size and response length
- **Training Data:** Pre-trained on large datasets with knowledge cutoff dates

## Best Practices

### Recommended
- Use clear, well-structured prompts
- Set appropriate parameters for your use case
- Implement proper error handling
- Monitor and optimize token usage

### Avoid
- Exposing API keys in client-side code
- Relying on exact output formatting without proper prompting
- Exceeding model context limits
- Using for sensitive/personal information without proper safeguards
