Clinical nurse scientist turned data specialist with 15 years of experience spanning health systems, research labs, academia, and digital health startups. I've co-created data products impacting 8M+ lives, raised $15M+ in venture funding for two early-stage companies, provided statistical consultation for basic & applied research studies at multiple R1 academic research centers, built a talent pipeline of â‰ˆ300 graduate informatics students with 90% placed in analytics roles within six months, and saved $500k at Stony Brook through custom BI data solutions.

Research and Academic Focus
======
As the Director of Scholarship, Innovation, and Analytics at Stony Brook University's School of Health Professions, I'm responsible for all research and scholarship activity across 11 departments, representing 100+ faculty and staff. My work includes reviewing and approving external grant applications, developing data solutions for academic programs, and mentoring faculty and students on research projects.

My research interests include:
- Applied AI/ML in healthcare settings
- Social determinants of health data integration
- Health informatics education and workforce development
- Patient-reported outcome measures in digital health

Industry Experience
======
In parallel with my academic career, I've maintained active involvement in the health tech industry. At Parsley Health, I created the Parsley Symptom Index, a validated assessment tool with over 1 million completions. I've also worked with companies like VirtualHealth, where I led analytics for care plans covering 8 million members, and served as a founder of BioVirtua, raising seed funding for pose-estimation telehealth products.

Through these experiences, I've developed expertise in:
- Building HIPAA-compliant data pipelines
- Designing and implementing clinical decision support tools
- Conducting geospatial analysis for healthcare resource allocation
- Creating empirically validated digital health assessment tools

Teaching and Mentorship
======
As an educator, I'm passionate about preparing the next generation of health informatics professionals. I teach courses in data science, cloud computing, database design, and research methodology at Stony Brook University. My teaching philosophy emphasizes hands-on, project-based learning with real-world applications.

I've also mentored numerous students and early-career professionals who have gone on to successful careers in health data science, clinical informatics, and health tech leadership.
